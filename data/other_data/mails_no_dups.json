I ran the attached picture in facial recognition. There were two matches that came up that look like the suspect. One of them is not coming up at all in CJIS. S91661890 comes up in facial recognition but when you enter that S# or his information in CJIS, there is no report at all. Before I send a fraudulent form to all the people that are requested, I just want to find out if it is a data error or why the R1 doesn\u2019t exist in CJIS.

I wanted to ask if you could provide me with any and all of the material you collected as part of your investigation. In particular, I am wondering if you have any fingerprints, birth certificates, facial recognition, supplemental reports, and information on the defendant\u2019s true name. Reading your report, it also appears that you were able to pull data from the Brockton and Taunton RMVs. Would you be able to provide that information as well?   I recall that I sent, or will send, you a summons for December 17, 2019 on another case.
