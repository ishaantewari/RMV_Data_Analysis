# RMV_Data_Analysis
Analyzing police data to identify cases of misuse of facial recognition technology.

Contained in this repo are a few of the files that we have used to narrow down the number of police emails we are interested in examining. The actual data is not included in this repo for privacy reasons.

Also, a pre-emptive apology for how messy the code is. We pretty much only need to execute each file once to produce a new .json file with concentrated data, so we haven't been worrying about how pretty the code looks :(

All code is the result of a collaborative effort between myself, Anahitha, Andrea, and Mr. Boxer. (I had to upload these files manually into the repo, so their commits are not logged here).
