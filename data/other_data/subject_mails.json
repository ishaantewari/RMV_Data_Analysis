At some point during this encounter,  the Defendant  provided officers w ith a Mass ID card  ); t he number came back with no  results in Massachusetts. This ID card was allegedly issued on 12/21/2017 and did not match a  license number for the Defendant(- ) The  Defendant claimed to have been born in Puerto  Rico and had never been issued a PR driver's license. Officers also reported that the Defendant had a  New Hampshire State ID as well as a criminal history in  NH . When officers ran the Defendant's Il l,  two FBI  numbers showed w ith the same demographic information. Officers were able to get in  contact with the t  w ho was born in  PR and now resides in the US. The  Defendant event ually confessed his true identity to be  \u00b7 however, facial  recognition has not come back to confirm, so it is unclear as to w hether this is t ruly the Defendant's  name. Apparently, the RMV has initiated proceedings against the Defendant  for using a false social  security number, but t he Defendant defaulted on those matters.  I understand t hat you are able to get RMV documents to assist us in identity fraud cases. I would like  to request the Defendant's RMV applications as well as any investigative documents that the RMV  has collected relative to t he Defendant's identity and use of this name/social security number. If any  of t he information I have provided you with is unclear please let me know. I can give you more  information or forward you a copy of t he police report.

This is the suspected vehicle he\u2019s in, it\u2019s believed to be a Ford Explorer or Mercury Mountaineer.  If anyone receives info on who he is please contact 301 or myself.     Thanks         Team,       At approximately 0846 today the male suspect in the attached photo successfully shoplifted two containers of OneTouch test strips. The suspect has been in our store on multiple occasions doing the same thing.          The suspect enters the store, shops for nonsense items, heads to Pharmacy, selects the test strips and makes his way to Toy's. There he removes the items from the Alpha Boxes with a key (there is no sign of damage to the boxes) and conceals them on his person.          The total amount shoplifted over a 3 week period is $560. I'm pretty sure we aren't the only ones being hit.

On arrival, officers spoke with the adult female victim who stated that a male suspect approached her from behind on foot, threw her to the ground and attempted to sexually assault her before fleeing the area.  The suspect (shown in the above image) is described as an   male in his late 20\u2019s, approximately 5\u201d8,slim build, a goatee, black hair in a ponytail, with tattoos on both arms wearing black and white sneakers, black shorts and a black T-shirt with white lettering.

I would like to know where he lives before we try anything possibly undercover with the phone (if he does not bite and dumps his phone, at least we already know where he lives).  If we can confirm some of the warrants beforehand as being him, that would be helpful.  My guess is that, by listing   as his address, he may be keeping coke and guns at his true address.

Thanks to you, we have a substantial amount of discovery, but Judge Horgan asked us \u2013 and seemed doubtful \u2013 whether we could prove this case at trial.   Based off your call with Helena, it seems that a number of his aliases were matched on the facial recognition software, he came in for an unrelated hearing, and was arrested. For trial, it would seem like we would need (i) a facial recognition expert who would be able to testify at trial to the different photos being the same person (ii) someone who might be able to explain how the facial recognition software works (iii) you to detail the investigation and tie it all together.   Does that seem right to you? And are you aware of any experts that you have worked with in the past who might be able to serve in roles I and II above?   I\u2019ll be in and out of the office with limited access to email till next Wednesday, but hope to hear from you soon.   Best, Will Ryan Suffolk County DA\u2019s Office",

I am hoping you could help answer a quick question for me and possible find a DL photo for a Subject of one of our passport fraud cases  .   The SUBJECT,  , has stolen/used at least a dozen different identities over the years. One of those identities is   (DOB:  ). Per NLETS/CJIS, it appears he did have a MA DL in this identity at one point (# S ). However, there doesn\u2019t seem to be any photo attached to the DL that I can find. CJIS also lists the DL # as \u201cNo status found on record\u201d. Could you provide any insight as to why there would be a DL# associated with this identity, but there be \u201cno status on record\u201d?

Questions for RMV to answer:   I'm assuming the RMV makes these photos available to police if they ask for it? The RMV makes digitized images of credential holders available to law enforcement so law enforcement may confirm the veracity of the credentials presented to them. Are there any steps the RMV takes to protect the privacy of individuals? The dissemination of RMV held images is strictly controlled by the federal driver privacy protection act. (As an example, the DPPA prohibits the RMV from releasing license image photos to the media.)   Also, besides the RMV, does the DOT use facial recognition in any way? MassDOT does not use facial recognition beyond the Registry\u2019s use which is strictly controlled by the federal driver privacy protection act and policy guidelines. Thanks,   Judi    ",

A Il l que ry revea led  two dif fe rent  FBI numbers.  At that point, I be lieved I had  an \"Impostor\" situat ion .  I reached  out t o the Fusion Cent er for assistance w ith facial recognition, who provided va rious OLNs  based upon t he facial recognition hits .  These OLNS are listed be low and ref lect t he same  party using different names,  DOBs, and 55#:  - - I t he n rece ived  an ema il from PR  Police Department, w hich matched t he PR  License  holder I  had on the stop.  The refore, I kicked  him loose, believing t he passenger may have bee n the  victim of t he Impostor, to wh ich  he no knowledge .  Att ached  in t his ema il are t he RMV photos from PR  and MA, as well as t he PR  License t he  passenger possessed .  Another flag t hat caught my eye was the PR  License itself.  The license  issue dat e was 03/2 1/2017.  I have a PDF  Document from t he Fraud Department in  NYPD,  w hich covers PR  Lice nses issued in 2019.

I'm not  sure if t he PR  lice nses issued in 2017 printed with differe nt security measu res,  but  it  came back va lid from PR  RMV.

        "body": "Good afternoon:   I\u2019m writing to request certified application records for \u201c \u201d (DOB:  ). On 5/6/2019, Officers Bedard and Monk from Salem PD conducted a traffic stop. The person they stopped, the defendant, identified himself as  . He gave a driver\u2019s license for \u201c \u201d (S ). After running his information, officers saw 2 FBI numbers for a \u201d \u2013both numbers coming back with the same name, date of birth, and social security #. One FBI # came back to someone born in Puerto Rico, the other born in the Dominican Republic. One FBI number corresponded with a State ID number which showed a 2009 arrest out of Lynn. Officers requested the booking photo on that case and it matched the person they stopped on 5/6. That FBI # was identified as the defendant.   Puerto Rico Warrants and Extradition sent an RMV photo of the real  \u201d -who doesn\u2019t look like the defendant. I\u2019m not sure how to request an RMV photo from Puerto Rico, I\u2019m assuming I have to go through the Puerto Rico DMV but let me know if you have any advice on that!   After investigation, officers determined that the defendant is actually named   (DOB:  0). Facial recognition from the DR matched the defendant\u2019s booking photo with someone named \u201c \u201d. A facebook search showed a \u201c \u201d matching the defendant\u2019s appearance, with an account saying he\u2019s from the DR. Officer\u2019s searched   school districts and found that there is a child living at the same address as the defendant (  01945). That child has a \u201c \u201d listed as his father. That child and another also have last names  .\u201d   Defendant also has a driver\u2019s license from the DR  -I have no idea how to get this but I\u2019m assuming it\u2019d be through a DR agency and not our RMV..   I\u2019m requesting the applications because I have to prove that the defendant used another person\u2019s personal information to obtain something of value, here, an identification card. To do that, I would need to prove that   used   information to obtain a MA driver\u2019s license.   Let me know if you need any more information. Thanks,   Kelly Waldo Assistant District Attorney Essex County District Attorney\u2019s Office 56 Federal Street Salem, MA 01960 P: (978) 744-5681 ex.4114 F: (978) 744-9064   The preceding email message (including any attachments) contains information that may be confidential, may be protected by the attorney-client or other applicable privileges, or may constitute non-public information.

I\u2019ve been trying to figure out how to prove my case\u2014it was an investigation after a random query on a license plate when an officer got a double hit on an FBI number.  A few months later, a motor vehicle stop was conducted and my defendant (who claimed to be one \u201c \u201d from PR) was arrested for identity fraud.  It took a couple of days, but they were able to obtain his identity based on a hit on facial recognition on a Dominican passport.  I\u2019m on a much tighter timeline than Kelly is\u2014my defendant could post bail but is refusing to give up his passport as a condition of his release.  And by much tighter timeline, I mean, my trial is set for Thursday and I need to provide items to defense attorney by end of the day on Tuesday.   Any chance you think we can pull a miracle on this one?  I have a copy of the Puerto Rican license\u2014 just not certified.   Thanks! Haleigh   Assistant District Attorney Haleigh A.

Malhotra (857-324-0411) on this e-mail and you may wish to reach out to him for additional information if you have questions regarding the registry side of things.  Facial Recognition on that first photograph of your suspect did not return any matches to any \u00a0  MA licenses or IDs, so it does not appear that he has obtained any new credentials at this point. Similarly, Coplink FaceMatch has returned no close matches to any booking additional photographs in the system. That said, there are a couple of address associated with the suspect that might be useful to you:  - Listed on the Facial Recognition \"match\" that doesn't return \u00a0 in CJIS  - Listed on the MA DL for   (DOB:  One of the photos on the   Facebook profile shows your suspect in front of a vehicle bearing MA: 3HD196, registered to     also appears in a bunch of the photos on the   profile (possibly a girlfriend/spouse)?

This license has been expired since 9-25-2002. The image in CJIS is the only one we have on file.   In my professional opinion, given the varying aging effect of a Hispanic male, I believe the facial biometrics in the given pictures present enough of a resemblance that a reasonable person would believe the persons depicted may be one in the same and therefore further investigation is warranted.

Originally started as a traffic stop for excessive tint. The driver, which I almost instantly identified as Dominican (my native \"tongue\" is Puerto Rican) and he also did not deny his nationality, presented a Pennsylvania drivers license in the name of  . The vehicle was also registered to this Mr.   Officers received no info back from PA or valid license in MA. Our Detective went to print him while at the station and noticed he was an individual she had recently written a warrant for, but the name didn't match up. He was subsequently identified as Mr.   (has arrests for violent assaults, guns and drug distribution). We're still unsure if this is his true identity. My question is are there an additional charges we could have applied? Also, if there are any \"cheat sheet\" or slides you could email me so I could re-fresh myself with the indicators to make this process a bit more smoother next time? Any feedback would be appreciated. Thanks.    \u200b\u200b  ",

Obviously the SS card is laminated which is not great.  The Birth Certificate does shows security threads under UV light.

He is currently on parole up here for another 12 months but I strongly believe he is not who he says he is claiming to be.

The biggest problem was that a subject matching his biographical information had multiple arrest photos and an active license in Puerto Rico that WAS NOT the person I was looking at.  Further, during an interview, his story was full of more questions than answers. If you could please view the documents I attached as well as the photos and let me know what you think.  Obviously the SS card is laminated which is not great.  The Birth Certificate does shows security threads under UV light.  He claims he was already living in the US and asked \u2018a friend\u2019 to get a replacement Birth Certificate for him and send it to him in Boston, MA.  He is currently on parole up here for another 12 months but I strongly believe he is not who he says he is claiming to be.  I had ICE fingerprint him but it only showed his previous arrests under this identity.  He claims he left Puerto Rico sometimes between 2010/2012 and came to Boston.

I  have been  working closely with Kathy McDonough from NESPIN and have identified  him as an  imposter. I  am in the process of completing the imposter portion of the report while we  continue our narcotics end of the investigation. The true number holder is possibly living in  Pennsylvania whom I  am attempting to track down and speak with. I  am also attempting to  figure out his true identity in the next week or so before we wrap up the investigation.  Just wondering if you want me to stay in touch with you about the open drug investigation  and was  wondering if I  should continue to file an immediate threat as soon as we wrap up  our case?  I  appreciate your time as always.  -Jim  James P.

Richard Poirier MSP Narcotics and Tpr. Steven Hanafin MSP Andover. They asked for a check of the photo associated with MA DL# S   DOB:  . The facial recognition query resulted in four additional licenses potentially associated with the suspect. All of the R1 information is attached, except for the one belonging to  DOB:   MA DL# S  because it is not available through CJIS.

I believe you may have previously been working with ADA Boulanger on this case, but it has been reassigned to me. I see in my a good chunk of discovery on this case, which looks like a lot of RMV materials and documents showing the conflicting ID. However, I wanted to see if you might have any additional discovery. In particular, do you have anything on the defendant\u2019s birth certificate, any facial recognition used in the case, or fingerprints.   The case is currently scheduled for a pretrial date tomorrow, though because I did not reach out sooner, I did not summons you for the date. I am just trying to get a sense of if there is any else that might be out there.   Thanks Andrew   Andrew S.
