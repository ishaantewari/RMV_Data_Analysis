The image is of a fraudulent  drivers license, social security number used not an S#, the personal information is for the victim but the picture is of someone else. The victim was notified by   credit card that an account was being opened in her name and the victim's business information was compromised as well. The suspect had all the personal data on the victim and also business information including Tax ID. I am trying to identify the person in the photo for follow up on knowledge of this activity.

I noticed that it looked like they could be the same person. When I entered the name  into Coplink,  appeared as an alias. However, when you search   in Coplink,   does not appear as an alias. The MA license that  appeared in is expired. It is not flagged as fraudulent in my version, and there are no notes that I could see linking him to  . There is no alias listed on his bop, but it is listed on the triple I under his FBI number. I realize that I am probably confusing everybody. I am confused as to why an alias appears in some documents, and not in others. Attached is the information that I found. If you need any more information or clarification, please let me know.

At some point during this encounter,  the Defendant  provided officers w ith a Mass ID card  ); t he number came back with no  results in Massachusetts. This ID card was allegedly issued on 12/21/2017 and did not match a  license number for the Defendant(- ) The  Defendant claimed to have been born in Puerto  Rico and had never been issued a PR driver's license. Officers also reported that the Defendant had a  New Hampshire State ID as well as a criminal history in  NH . When officers ran the Defendant's Il l,  two FBI  numbers showed w ith the same demographic information. Officers were able to get in  contact with the t  w ho was born in  PR and now resides in the US. The  Defendant event ually confessed his true identity to be  \u00b7 however, facial  recognition has not come back to confirm, so it is unclear as to w hether this is t ruly the Defendant's  name. Apparently, the RMV has initiated proceedings against the Defendant  for using a false social  security number, but t he Defendant defaulted on those matters.  I understand t hat you are able to get RMV documents to assist us in identity fraud cases. I would like  to request the Defendant's RMV applications as well as any investigative documents that the RMV  has collected relative to t he Defendant's identity and use of this name/social security number.

Attached are t he two  fake Rhode Island drivers licenses they provided for us to run facial  recognition on. I ran  both images  and got potential matches to MA DLs, with different names and DOBs than attached to the RI DLs.   I ran both RI DL numbers in CJIS, but one is listed as not on file and the other is associated to a different name and DOB. I then ran the names and DOBs on the licenses in CJIS and found individuals that match the information on the licenses (except for the DL number and Image).   It does not appear to be the typical fraud ID case, but they are using names, addresses, and DOBs of real Rhode Island residents.
